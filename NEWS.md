# glasstabs 0.3.3

## Native-layout parity

* `glassSelect()` and `glassMultiSelect()` gained a `width` argument
  (passed to `shiny::validateCssUnit()`) so the widgets can fill a column or
  match a fixed layout, like native `selectizeInput()`.
* Both selects now accept grouped choices as a named list, selectInput()-style
  (e.g. `list(Fruit = c(Apple = "apple"), Veg = c(...))`), rendering
  non-interactive group headers. Search hides headers whose options are all
  filtered out.
* Added disabled support: `disabled = TRUE` greys out and blocks the whole
  widget, and `disabled_choices` renders individual options as non-selectable.
  Both are also reachable at runtime via `updateGlassSelect()` /
  `updateGlassMultiSelect()` (`disabled`, `disabled_choices`). Disabled options
  are skipped by "Select all".
* `glassTabsUI()` gained a `shape` argument (`"rounded"` default or
  `"square"`) so the tab bar and content corners can match
  `shape = "square"` selects for a cohesive, selectize-style layout.

## Square corners

* Added a `shape` argument to `glassSelect()` and `glassMultiSelect()`. The
  default `shape = "rounded"` keeps the signature glass look, while
  `shape = "square"` applies crisp, selectize-style corners so the widgets sit
  flush next to native `selectizeInput()` controls without looking out of
  place.
* `updateGlassSelect()` and `updateGlassMultiSelect()` gained a `shape`
  argument so the corner style can be switched at runtime from the server
  without re-rendering the widget (open dropdowns and selection state are
  preserved).
* Added a `runGlassExample("square-corners")` example app that demonstrates the
  square shape live alongside native `selectizeInput()`, including a
  runtime rounded-vs-square toggle via `update*()` and a light-theme variant.
* Added a `runGlassExample("bslib")` example app that shows square
  `glassSelect()` and `glassMultiSelect()` controls inside a Bootstrap 5
  `bslib` layout.

## Large choice sets

* Added opt-in server-side search support for large `glassSelect()` and
  `glassMultiSelect()` choice sets via `server = TRUE`, `glassSelectServer()`,
  and `glassMultiSelectServer()`.
* Added loading and no-results states for select search results, including
  server-backed search responses.
* Added a runnable `runGlassExample("server-select")` example and vignette
  sections for server-backed single- and multi-select controls.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed `updateGlassMultiSelect()` updates being lost when a multi-select is
  created or replaced by `renderUI()` in the same reactive flush. Dynamic
  updates now target the replacement widget and retry briefly while it binds.
* Fixed scalar `selected` values being interpreted as an empty selection by the
  multi-select JavaScript binding.

# glasstabs 0.3.2

## Public dashboard readiness

* Removed all `color-mix()` usage from the shipped stylesheet. Select widget
  alpha colors are now precomputed as CSS custom properties at render time for
  better compatibility with older embedded browsers.
* Added ARIA combobox/listbox/option semantics to `glassSelect()` and
  `glassMultiSelect()`, with JavaScript keeping `aria-expanded` and
  `aria-selected` in sync during interaction.
* Improved keyboard behavior for select widgets: Escape and Tab close open
  dropdowns and return focus to the trigger; single-select option clicks also
  return focus.
* Added CSP nonce support for inline style tags via the
  `glasstabs.csp_nonce` option.
* Added Windows High Contrast (`forced-colors`) CSS support and RTL layout
  support for tabs and select widgets.
* Improved narrow-screen select trigger behavior so labels truncate cleanly
  inside dashboard cards instead of overflowing.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed tab initialization for `glassTabsUI()` inserted by `renderUI()` or
  dashboard layouts after the initial page boot.
* Added a Shiny input binding and delegated activation fallback for tabs so
  click and keyboard activation remain reliable in public dashboards.
* Bumped the html dependency version so browsers request fresh CSS/JS assets.

# glasstabs 0.3.1

## New features

* Added `glassTabCondition(id, value)` — generates the correct JavaScript
  condition string for [shiny::conditionalPanel()] without needing to remember
  the `input[["id-active_tab"]]` key pattern.
* Added `glasstabs_news()` — prints the package changelog to the R console.
* Added `ROADMAP.md` tracking planned features and known limitations (not
  shipped in the package).

## Improvements

* Error messages across all functions are now actionable: they name the bad
  argument class, show what was received, and suggest the correct fix.
* `glass_tab_theme()` and `glass_select_theme()` now have full `@examples`
  with interactive app snippets.
* `.gt-container` no longer forces `max-width:960px` or `margin:48px auto` —
  the widget now behaves like a normal block element inside Shiny layouts.
* Light-mode halo box-shadow replaced with a soft blue-tinted shadow via the
  `--gt-halo-shadow` CSS variable, replacing the harsh dark drop shadow.

# glasstabs 0.3.0

## New features

### Tab widget

* Added `runGlassExample()` to launch any of the built-in example apps
  directly from the R console (`runGlassExample("smoke-test")`, etc.).
* Added `icon` argument to `glassTabPanel()` — accepts any htmltools-compatible
  tag (e.g. `shiny::icon("table")`). Renders with `gt-tab-icon` / `gt-tab-label`
  spans so icon and text can be styled independently.
* Added `disableGlassTab()` and `enableGlassTab()` — gray out a tab without
  hiding it. Completes the visibility/disabled/removal trio alongside
  `showGlassTab()` / `hideGlassTab()`.
* Added `updateGlassTabBadge()` — set a numeric count badge on any tab button.
  Pass `count = 0` or `count = NA` to hide the badge. Values above 99 display
  as `"99+"`.
* `glassTabsServer()` now integrates with Shiny's URL bookmarking: the active
  tab is automatically saved and restored when `enableBookmarking = "url"` is
  set on the app. Opt out per widget with `bookmark = FALSE`.
* Added `glassTabsOutput()` / `renderGlassTabs()` for server-driven tab
  rendering. The JavaScript engine re-initialises automatically after each
  render via a scoped `shiny:value` listener, so no manual `glasstabs_reinit`
  calls are needed.

## Improvements

* `glassTabsUI()` now errors early on duplicate `glassTabPanel()` values,
  reporting the offending value(s) by name.
* `glassTabsUI()` gains a `compact = FALSE` argument. Setting `compact = TRUE`
  applies the `.gt-compact` CSS modifier which reduces margins, tab-link padding,
  font size, and content area padding — ideal for embedding inside bs4Dash cards
  or any tight dashboard layout.
* `glassTabsServer()` emits a `warning()` when the `id` argument contains `"-"`,
  which is the most common sign that `ns("tabs")` was passed instead of the bare
  `"tabs"` id. The warning includes corrective guidance.
* CSS: added `.gt-tab-disabled`, `.gt-tab-icon`, `.gt-tab-label`, and
  `.gt-tab-badge` rules. Badges adapt their background to the active halo colour
  via the existing CSS custom property.
* CSS: all color values are now consumed via `var(--gt-xxx, fallback)` instead
  of being hardcoded — this was the root cause of light theme appearing invisible.
  Light theme defaults were also strengthened for better contrast.
* CSS: dropdown active-state z-index raised to 9000/9001 so glasstabs dropdowns
  render above bs4Dash card stacking contexts.
* `shiny:value` listener limits bootAll re-initialisation to outputs that
  actually contain glasstabs elements, so ordinary Shiny outputs are unaffected.
* Added `inst/cheatsheet/glasstabs-cheatsheet.tex` — a printable four-column
  LaTeX reference card covering the full API, module pattern, bs4Dash integration,
  theming, and common gotchas.

## Documentation

* Cheatsheet vignette (`vignettes/cheatsheet.Rmd`) extended with new sections:
  "Tabs inside a Shiny module", "Dynamic tab values and selected",
  "Tabs inside bs4Dash", and updated common gotchas.
* All new functions have full roxygen docs, `@examples`, and cross-links.

# glasstabs 0.2.1
 
## New features

### Tab widget

* Added `updateGlassTabsUI()` for programmatic tab switching from the server.
* Added `showGlassTab()` and `hideGlassTab()` for dynamically showing and
  hiding tabs at runtime.
* Added `appendGlassTab()` and `removeGlassTab()` for adding and removing tabs
  at runtime.

## Improvements

* `glassTabsUI()` now validates `selected` against the available
  `glassTabPanel()` values and errors early on invalid tab ids.
* The tab widget now reports its initial active tab to Shiny immediately after
  session startup, so `glassTabsServer()` is populated on first render.
* Added ARIA roles and selected-state attributes to tab navigation markup.
* Improved tab re-initialization and transition handling for dynamic tab
  changes, including show/hide, append/remove, and rapid successive updates.
* Improved halo and transfer-trace positioning after runtime tab layout
  changes.

## Bug fixes
 
* Opening a dropdown now closes any other open glasstabs dropdown, fixing
  a visual stacking issue where multiple dropdowns appeared simultaneously.
 
* Improved widget lifecycle in dynamic UI (`renderUI()`, `conditionalPanel()`).
  Widgets initialize more reliably and clean up properly when removed.
 
* Widgets now emit their initial value to Shiny immediately after rendering,
  fixing timing issues with `conditionalPanel()` and dynamic UI.
 
## Internal improvements
 
* JavaScript engine refactored to use internal state instead of DOM scanning.
  No changes to the R API — all existing code works without modification.
 
* Added scroll containers for long option lists, debounced search, and
  `.gt-loading` / `.gt-disabled` CSS utility classes.

## Documentation

* Added a dedicated cheatsheet vignette for common widget patterns and
  server-side helpers.
* Added a smoke-test example app covering programmatic tab switching, dynamic
  tab visibility, runtime tab insertion/removal, and rapid interaction paths.
* Expanded README and pkgdown navigation to surface the new server-side tab
  controls and cheatsheet more clearly.

* Added configurable `all_label` support to control the trigger text shown when all choices are selected.

## Improvements

* Aligned `glassSelect()` and `glassMultiSelect()` more closely with standard Shiny input behavior.
* Added client-side input bindings so select widgets now support `session$sendInputMessage()` update patterns.
* Preserved current `glassMultiSelect()` default behavior where `selected = NULL` initializes all choices as selected.
* Improved choice normalization so named choices retain display labels correctly.
* Improved hue normalization for the `"filled"` multi-select style.
* Updated vignettes and examples to show direct Shiny input usage and server-side update patterns.

## Documentation

# glasstabs 0.1.0

Initial release.

## New features

### Tab widget

* `glassTabsUI()` — animated glassmorphism-style tab navigation with a sliding
  glass halo and transfer trace between tabs.
* `glassTabPanel()` — defines a single tab button and its content pane.
* `glassTabsServer()` — reactive helper that tracks the active tab value.
* `glass_tab_theme()` — custom color theme for `glassTabsUI()` with eight
  independent handles: `tab_text`, `tab_active_text`, `halo_bg`,
  `halo_border`, `content_bg`, `content_border`, `card_bg`, `card_text`.
* Built-in `"dark"` (default) and `"light"` presets for `glassTabsUI()`.
* Keyboard navigation using the Left and Right arrow keys.
* Full `bs4Dash` compatibility via `wrap = FALSE`.

### Multi-select filter widget

* `glassMultiSelect()` — dropdown filter with live search,
  select-all with indeterminate state, and three checkbox indicator styles:
  `"checkbox"`, `"check-only"`, and `"filled"`.
* `glassFilterTags()` — tag-pill display area that stays in sync with a
  `glassMultiSelect()` automatically via JavaScript; clicking × on a pill
  deselects that option.
* `glass_select_theme()` — custom color theme with four handles: `bg_color`,
  `border_color`, `text_color`, `accent_color`.
* Built-in `"dark"` and `"light"` presets for `glassMultiSelect()`.

  UI chrome (all default `TRUE`).
* Per-option HSL hue angles for the `"filled"` style via the `hues` argument
  (auto-assigned if omitted).

### General

* `useGlassTabs()` — injects CSS and JavaScript via
  `htmltools::htmlDependency`, which is deduplicated automatically by Shiny.
* All theming uses pre-computed CSS variables (no `color-mix()`), ensuring
  compatibility with Shiny's embedded browser.
* Multiple instances of either widget on the same page work independently;
  each instance is sc
